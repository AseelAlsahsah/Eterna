      As a buyer, it has always been a comfortable situation to work with Johnson Consulting Group because of their strong foundation of honesty. Working with David Adams on the last sale was a pleasure.  David took the work out of the sale for me and did an excellent job of communicating, solving problems, and achieving results far in excess of what I could have achieved.   As I continue to work towards my retirement, you can be assured I will be trusting David Adams at Johnson Consulting Group to represent me.
